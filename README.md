🌱 CropDoctor – AI-Powered Plant Disease Detection System
✅ Project Description

CropDoctor is an advanced web application built using Django, Python, MySQL, and Artificial Intelligence to solve a major problem faced by farmers worldwide — early detection of plant diseases.
This system allows farmers to upload photos of their crop leaves and instantly receive an analysis powered by AI, which identifies the disease, provides confidence scores, symptoms, and recommended solutions.

It is a complete solution designed to make plant disease diagnosis affordable, fast, and accessible, especially in rural areas where expert consultation is hard to find.

🚀 How It Works
1. The farmer signs up and logs in to the system.
2. Farmer uploads an image of a plant leaf (via mobile or desktop).
3. The system uses an AI-powered CNN model to analyze the image and detect any disease.
4. The system returns:
   ✅ Detected disease name
   ✅ Symptoms
   ✅ Recommended solution (organic and chemical remedies)
   ✅ Confidence score (%)
5. All reports are saved in the user’s dashboard for future reference.
6. Admin and Experts can manage the database of plants, diseases, and tips.
7. (Advanced) Optional: Weather-based risk prediction helps farmers stay ahead of disease outbreaks.

✅ Core Features:-
1. User Authentication System (Farmer, Expert, Admin roles)
2. Crop Image Upload (Mobile/Desktop support)
3. AI-Based Disease Detection (using TensorFlow/PyTorch)
4. Display of Disease Information:
    1. Disease Name
    2. Symptoms
    3. Solution/Cure Methods
    4. Confidence Score
5. History of Uploaded Reports
6. Admin Dashboard for Managing Data
7. Expert Role for Validating and Updating Disease Information
